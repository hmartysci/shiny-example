Description: A small Shiny app demonstrating what I have learned about Shiny so
    far. The app consists of three tabs, each of which displays a bar graph
    based on a dataset from Râ€™s datasets package. On each tab, a select input is
    used to choose an attribute, which becomes the categorical variable
    according to which data from the dataset is categorized to plot the bar
    graph.
